\subsection{Beam Checkout with Superharps and Beam Position
			Monitors}\label{beam-checkout-with-superharps-and-beam-position-monitors}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Experts: Mark Jones
		\item
		Expected time: 3 hours
		\item
		Initial measurement of beam spot size. Followed by calibration of
		girder BPMs
		\item
		Conditions:
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{tabular}[]{|c|c|} \hline\hline
		beam current: & 5 μA\\ \hline
		fast raster: & off\\ \hline
		target: & none\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		Ask MCC to do superharp scan with superharps IHA3H07A and IHA3H07B and
		put entry in ELOG. Record the 3 BPMs positions (3H07A,3H07B,3H07C)
		during scan.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			Want beam spot with sigma\_x and sigma\_y below 200 um ( beam pass
			1-4) and below 300 um for beam pass 5.
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				If beam spot size is too large contact Run Coordinator to decide
				how to proceed.
				\item
				If good beam spot size, then this will be first point in beam
				alignment
			\end{itemize}
			\item
			Determine the BPM offset from measure harp position
			\item
			Are X (Y) from IHA3H07A and IHA3H07B at zero within 300 um?
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item
				If not ask MCC to center using the BPMs as relative guide.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		Calibrate Girder BPMs to the girder harps at 5uA
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam horizontally by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam vertically by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		Calibrate Girder BPMs to the girder harps at 30uA
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam horizontally by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam vertically by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		Calibrate Girder BPMs to the girder harps at 60uA
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam horizontally by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
			\item
			Ask MCC to move the beam vertically by ±2 mm, and record at each
			setting both superharps and the three BPM's, both from MEDM/TCL and
			from the data stream after short runs.
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		Check raster size use harp at 10uA
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			Take harp scans with a fast raster with varying size, say 2 by 2, 3
			by 3, and 4 by 4 mm2.
